# ðŸ“š Library Management System 

This is a basic text-based Library Management System made using Python. I created this project as part of my early learning in programming to practice file handling, functions, and user input. It stores and manages book data using a `.txt` file.

# Features

-  Add new books  
-  View all books  
-  Search books by title or author  
-  Mark books as unavailable  
-  Mark unavailable books as available *(newly added)*  
-  Stores book data in a `.txt` file on the local system

# Why I Made This

I wanted to start small with a manageable but useful project. I like books, so the idea of managing them with Python felt practical and fun. It also helped me understand how to work with data without needing a database.

# How to Run

1. Make sure you have **Python 3** installed  
2. Download or clone the repo  
3. Run the code in your terminal or IDE (like VS Code)


python library_system.py


# Notes
This is my first fully functional project with file handling and menu-based user interaction. More features like deleting a book or editing book details may be added later as I learn more.


#About Me
I'm a student currently exploring programming and trying to improve through hands-on learning. I'm also interested in robotics and creative arts like painting and crochet. You can check out more projects on my GitHub as I grow!
